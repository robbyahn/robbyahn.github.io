Hey there, fellow digital enthusiasts! I'm Robby, a web developer with a flair for crafting unforgettable online experiences. My journey in the realm of web development has led me to master [Silverstripe CMS](https://www.silverstripe.com/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), and the art of web design. Specializing in crafting robust themes with rock-solid multi-browser support, I bring a blend of creativity and technical finesse to every project.

But that's not all! During my time at a prestigious news agency, I delved into the world of Advertisement Design, honing my skills in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. And let's not forget my passion for programming, where I've dabbled in Jade, Java, and JavaScript, all while keeping the principles of information design close at hand.
