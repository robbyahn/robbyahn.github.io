As a member of the UI team at FNZ, my responsibilities included overseeing all UI components and UX for the Wealth Hub project, which serves as a wealth management tool for the National Australia Bank (NAB), a banking solution provider serving various banks globally. In my role, I serve as a front-end developer/web designer collaborating with the NAB UI team.
